    npx create-electron-app@latest my-new-app --template=vite-typescript


I have an electron/js example project (../electron-in-docker/) that I'd like to copy and
convert to Typescript. 

- Can you convert the code and use it to replace the source in this project
- Can you confirm the code builds without errors
